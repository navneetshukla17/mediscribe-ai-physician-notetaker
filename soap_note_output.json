    "History_of_Present_Illness": "Patient reports being involved in a motor vehicle accident on September 1st, around 12:30 PM. She was stopped in traffic when her vehicle was rear-ended, pushing her into the car in front. She was wearing her seatbelt. Immediately after the accident, she experienced shock and pain in her neck and back, hitting her head on the steering wheel. She sought medical attention at Moss Bank Accident and Emergency, where she was diagnosed with whiplash. She did not have X-rays. The first four weeks post-accident were difficult with significant neck and back pain, impacting her sleep and requiring regular painkillers. She underwent ten physiotherapy sessions which helped with stiffness and discomfort. Currently, she experiences occasional backaches, which are not constant and significantly less severe than before. She denies any anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating. The accident required her to take one week off work, but she has since returned to her usual routine and has not been significantly limited in her daily activities or hobbies.",
